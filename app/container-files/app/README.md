# CS50W-2020-Project-1

Screencast presenting my website:

This is the project 1 of the 2020 version of CS50 Web programming with Python and JavaScript. It consists in a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia built with Django.

The users can access encyclopedia entries via URL entry, clicking their title from the index page or entering their name in the search box. They can edit already existing entries or create new ones. They can also click a button that will take them to a random entry page. Every entry content is stored as a Markdown file, since it is a lighter-weight markup language and more human-friendly than HTML.
