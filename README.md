# Harvard-project-Wiki

Screencast presenting my website: https://youtu.be/jdRKifP4J58

This is a web application which consists in a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia built with Django as my Project 1 of the Harvard course CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (2020 version).

Users can access encyclopedia entries via URL entry, clicking their title from the index page or entering their name in the search box. They can edit already existing entries or create new ones. They can also click a button that will take them to a random entry page. Every entry content is stored as a Markdown file, since it is a lighter-weight markup language and more human-friendly than HTML.

To launch and access the web application, open the pulled repository in your UNIX terminal and run the following command (without "sudo" unless the terminal asks it):
# bash app/run-me.sh
